# ballerelo


basic elo plugin made for jballs.org. the plugin attempts to add csgo-style elo and ranks to the game, depending on the player's kills. if they kill another player, they rank up and gain elo. if they die to another player, they lose elo and go down in ranks.

# TODO
- Discord commands (/elo [playername] to show another player's elo)
- End crystal kill detection (broken rn)
- Cleanup and changes
